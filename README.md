# Daily-Calendar
This a simple calendar application that allows you to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and will dynamically update for each new event you add

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time

* A field to input events

* A save button

Just click in the text area corresponding with the time you want to block, enter your event, and click the save button.
